## Description
For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## App
Search for a employee name in the search bar by full name, first name, or last name.(ex. Kathryn Meyer or Noah Morgan)
